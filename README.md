## Virus Simulation (work in progress)
The coronavirus pandemic of 2020 inspired me to create this program to simulate the behavior of viruses. 
As a starting point, I modified my implementation of the [Wa-Tor predator/prey simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa-Tor)
from Georgia Tech's CS 7492: Simulation of Biology course.
